# FastAPI-SQLAlchemy2

## Description
This project aims to demonstrate the transition from using SQLAlchemy v1 to SQLAlchemy v2 in a FastAPI project while maintaining the integrity of the database schema and ensuring the functionality remains intact.

## Steps to Achieve the Transition

1. Create Simple Todo Project with SQLAlchemy v1
2. Add Unit Tests for the Project
3. Change the Models to SQLAlchemy v2 (Use Mapped & Mapped_column)
4. Ensure That This Change Doesn't Alter the Table Schema
5. Rerun the Tests


## Conclusion
By following these steps, we aim to seamlessly upgrade our FastAPI project from SQLAlchemy v1 to SQLAlchemy v2 while maintaining the stability and reliability of our application. This transition not only allows us to leverage the enhanced features of SQLAlchemy v2 but also ensures compatibility with future updates and improvements.
